## Project description

In our project, we would like to obtain useful pieces of information from the website [iMDb](https://www.imdb.com). We are interesting in creating a database of movies along with their directors, actors, ratings, revenues and other data that can be further used for data analysis. Undeniably, many pieces of information that we will want to use are not going to be available directly on the website. That is why we wish to use other sources of information such as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).
