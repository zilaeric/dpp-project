## Project description

In our project, we would like to obtain useful pieces of information from the website [iMDb](https://www.imdb.com). We are interested in creating a dataset of movies along with their directors, actors, ratings, revenues, and other data that can be further used for data analysis. Undeniably, many pieces of information that we will want to use are not going to be available directly on the chosen website. That is why we wish to use other sources of information such as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) as well. While inclusion and combination of data from  different sources will present a relatively difficult challenge, it will allow us to look at the data in unique ways and (hopefully) find some interesting relationships. 

After we succeed at collecting and storing the data, we are going to focus on different aspects of data analysis. This will, of course, consist of basic overviews of the data, creating figures summarising them, and looking into modelling possibilities that would allow us to test our hypotheses.

To give an example, we would like to test the hypothesis that movies that are based on a book are in general more successful than other movies. We believe that this might be true due to easier marketing of such movies and the simple fact that the books themselves often need to succeed to be given the chance to appear on the silver screen. Another interesting relationship to be studied is the country of origin of a director and his or her success in the filmmaking world, which might be biased towards certain countries due to, to give an example,  the availability of university programmes in the field.
